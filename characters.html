                seasons of Stranger Things. He is best friends with Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair , Eleven, Will

                In 1983, when Dustin's friend, Will went missing, Dustin and the rest of his friends, Mike and
                Lucas went out to look for him, only to find a mysterious girl named Eleven who had telekinetic
                powers. Dustin had a neutral opinion of Eleven as she helped them look for Will, but he became
                good friends with her after she saved him and Mike from being killed by their school bullies.
                Dustin would continue to help his friends find Will and fight against a Demogorgon until it was
                killed by Eleven. In the end, Dustin and his friends were reunited with Will where they celebrated

                At first, concerned with simple teenage high school issues, her world is turned upside down

                grieving for the death of her best friend, Nancy's relationship with Steve Harrington fell apart,
                eventually causing the two to break up. Later, Nancy and Jonathan decided to take on a journey
                on themselves to expose Hawkins National Laboratory as a threat. Eventually, she helps
                Jonathan and his mother in removing Will Byers from the Mind Flayer. A month later, Nancy

              <p class="card_text">portrayed by Joe Keery, is a major protagonist of Stranger Things, having a
                recurring role in season one before being upgraded to a major role as of season 2.
                A student at Hawkins High School, he was best friends with Tommy H. and Carol Perkins and
                the boyfriend of Nancy Wheeler. When Nancy's best friend, Barbara Holland, disappeared, she
                became distant and Steve thought she was cheating with Jonathan Byers. Following a few
                ignorant actions, Steve had a change of heart, told his friends off, and set out to make things
                right. By coincidence, he ended up heroically saving the day and reconciled with his girlfriend.
                In 1984, following a falling-out with Nancy, Steve became a proper ally to the main party,
                especially Dustin, with whom he formed an unlikely friendship. He became a sort of authority
                figure for the party and solidified himself into becoming a major player in the battle against the
                Mind Flayer.</p>

                After Will mysteriously disappeared, Joyce was certain that he was communicating with her
                through the lights in her house. Despite everyone treating her as if she was having a mental
