              good friends with her after she saved him and Mike from being killed by their school bullies.
              Dustin would continue to help his friends find Will and fight against a Demogorgon until it was

            <p class="card_text">portrayed by Joe Keery, is a major protagonist of Stranger Things, having a
              recurring role in season one before being upgraded to a major role as of season 2.
              A student at Hawkins High School, he was best friends with Tommy H. and Carol Perkins and
              the boyfriend of Nancy Wheeler. When Nancy's best friend, Barbara Holland, disappeared, she
              became distant and Steve thought she was cheating with Jonathan Byers. Following a few
              ignorant actions, Steve had a change of heart, told his friends off, and set out to make things
              right. By coincidence, he ended up heroically saving the day and reconciled with his girlfriend.
              In 1984, following a falling-out with Nancy, Steve became a proper ally to the main party,
              especially Dustin, with whom he formed an unlikely friendship. He became a sort of authority
              figure for the party and solidified himself into becoming a major player in the battle against the
              Mind Flayer.</p>
